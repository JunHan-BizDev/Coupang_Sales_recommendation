143641187,5,2021.03.14,It's very comfortable.,I have been using the chair for a few months now and I have no complaints. It is comfortable to sit in for long periods and it supports me well. The quality of the chair seems good and I think it will last a long time. The material looks sturdy as well and doesn't smell. The feet slip on woorden floors but that is an easy fix with rubber foot pads. Delivery was quick; 3-4 days and the seller answered all my questions. Assembly was fairly easy but you need patience to assemble the back rest. Overall a great product and I would recommend it.,0,False
